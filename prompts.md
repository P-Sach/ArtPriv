Two Simple Flow Prompts (Human-Friendly)
Prompt 1: Donor Journey Flow (Simple Language)
A person visits the donor website and searches for banks in their area.
After selecting a bank, they submit their personal and medical interest information.
They create an account and wait for counseling to be scheduled based on the bank’s available timings and contact preferences.
The donor reviews and accepts four bank-specific consent forms that include the bank’s logo and legal details.
The bank verifies these consents.
The donor then completes medical testing.
Test reports may be uploaded either by the bank or by the donor if third-party testing is used.
Regardless of who uploads them, the donor can always view and download their test reports.
The bank reviews the test results and makes the final decision on eligibility.
Only after explicit bank approval is the donor fully onboarded.
Prompt 2: Bank Journey Flow (Simple Language)
A bank signs up on the platform using email and password.
The bank submits its basic details and official certification documents.
The bank waits for platform verification.
Once verified, the bank enters billing details, selects a subscription plan, and completes payment.
After onboarding, the bank gains access to its dashboard where it can manage donor leads, configure counseling schedules and contact methods, upload consent forms with branding, review test reports, and approve or reject donors.
